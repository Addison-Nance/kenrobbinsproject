## Purpose: 
To preserve the work of Ken Robbins in a searchable, sortable database to ensure all works are preserved for all time. 

## Value
This will serve as a way to preserve my grandfathers art in the event something where to happen to it. It will also serve as a way to share his works with the greater public so that they may appreciate his works as much as I do. 

## MVP
The user will be able to view, search based on keywords, and sort by date, alphabtical title, and art medium. The admin will be able to upload pictures, name (and rename), tag with keywords, and add/update description.

By July 31st, the user will be able to sort based on date, keywords, and alphabically and the admin will be able to upload works, add keyword tags, enter a title and description, and display it to the DOM. The admin will also be able to edit, re-order or delete entries. Each admin will have a unique user login and password and all changes made will be logged to a log.txt file.

## Page breakdown
The home page will a rotating carosell of some select works and a title. Upon scrolling, the entries will auto populate into a 4 wide grid with options to sort and search at the top of the grid. There will be "about" and "login" buttons in the top right corner. The about page will be similar to the home page but the entries will be replaced with a short bio about the artist. The login page will allow admin and superadmin to log in to create, and edit entries as well as view the change log. The superadmin will have the same permissions as the admin but will have the added option of adding admin accounts and deleting entries.
